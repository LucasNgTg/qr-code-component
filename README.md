### Built with

- Visual Studio Code
- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

The most time consuming part was trying to figure out the style values by eye. 

### Continued development

CSS has a lot of properties that achieve visually similar goals, which made it somewhat challenging to judge which would be best to get the results I wanted. I'll keep working on getting used to them.

### Useful resources

- [Shadow presets](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples) - This saved me time having to create the ```box-shadow``` from scratch.
